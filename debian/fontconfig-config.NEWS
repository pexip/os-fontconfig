fontconfig (2.12.3-0.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  Starting with version 2.12, fontconfig is using "Slight" (hintslight) as
  automatic hinting style. This might change the rendering of the fonts.

  If you want the to restore the old hinting, run "dpkg-reconfigure
  fontconfig-config" and select "Full" as hinting style.
